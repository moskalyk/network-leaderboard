# dx-leaderboard
The app helps users assemble leaderboards that listen to various key indicators when ranking contract addresses amongst one-another. 

The app allows for the following:
- total (HP / score / coin)
- least increment change (speed)
- most increment change (whales)

## future
leaderboards can be shareable via an IPFS link

## notes
in order to prevent coins transfering and mis-representing score, they can be minted as non-transferable, but burnable for a certain upgradeable reason (erc721/1155 redemption, allowable token swaps, etc.)
